# Changelog - Version 0.4.x

This file contains all changes for the 0.4.x release series.

## [0.4.0] - 2025-11-01

### Added - Advanced Linear Algebra

**Matrix Decompositions:**
- LU decomposition with partial pivoting (`lu`).
- QR decomposition using Householder reflections (`qr`).
- Cholesky decomposition for symmetric, positive-definite matrices (`cholesky`).
- Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (`svd`).

**Eigenvalue and Eigenvector Solvers:**
- Power Iteration method for finding the dominant eigenvalue (`power_iteration`).
- QR Algorithm for finding all eigenvalues of a matrix (`qr_eigenvalues`).
- Full symmetric eigenvalue solver (`eig`).

**Helper Functions:**
- `isSymmetric`
- `isPositiveDefinite`
- `identity`

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL**: Fixed a memory corruption (dangling pointer) bug in the Handle-to-JavaScript data retrieval process. This was caused by returning a pointer to a temporary object's data. The fix ensures all handle operations are stable and memory-safe.
- Corrected intermittent failures in eigenvalue tests, which were a symptom of the memory bug.

### Changed
- Refactored the internal implementation of the QR eigenvalue algorithm for clarity and robustness.

### Validation
- All 11 linear algebra tests now pass consistently.
- No regressions introduced in existing SDK, DSP, or Handle system tests.
