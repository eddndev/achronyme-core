// --- Vector Operations in SOC ---

// Declare a vector
let v = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// Square every element using map
let v_squared = map(x => x^2, v)

// Filter for elements greater than 10
let v_filtered = filter(x => x > 10, v_squared)

// Sum the remaining elements
let final_sum = reduce((acc, x) => acc + x, 0, v_filtered)

// The result of the last expression is final_sum
final_sum
